# HyAI

### Introduction
This repository consists of source files for the implementation of a hybrid AI (HyAI) framework. We have not publicly available the HyAI Knowledge Graph (KG) due to sensitive information about chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients. HyAI is conceptualized following the design principles described by Bekkhum, V, et al. [**Design Patterns**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02394-3); following basic vocabulary for representing the components actor, input and output, process, and models (as depicted in the below Figure). HyAI framework consists of four design patterns: (i) Ontology and KG, (ii) KG Embedding, (iii) Pattern Detection, and (iv) Pattern Analysis and Explanation.
